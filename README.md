# Action Segmentation and Behavioral Analysis in Decision-Making Tasks

![Diagnostics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd0dca2d-c497-4ed1-822c-69451a287111)

This repository contains the code I wrote for my research on action segmentation in mice performing a standardized decision-making task, conducted at the Zuckerman Mind Brain and Behavior Institute at Columbia University. My work focused on the development of diagnostic tools to assess the efficacy of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) models for predicting behavioral states, and analyzing the relationship between these behaviors and neural activity. Behavioral and neural datasets from the International Brain Lab (IBL) were used, and the group's efforts were focused on identifying unique behavioral fingerprints in mice across sessions.
